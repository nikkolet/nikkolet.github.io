    <h1>Notes & Exercies</h1>
    <h2>Week 2</h2>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>On my main index.html I attached the main.js to show all of the links to the different weeks notes and exercises.<br> I can't remember a simplified way to project the labels out so that it shows all of them without having to put them all individually
                in. In the future I will work to see if I can get it in a for loop so that way I can simplify my code.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>For the second exercise I seemed to have some issues getting it just right. I used .toUpperCase() and Capitalize() yet it still didn't produce the output I was looking for.<br> I ended up using the .replace() within a function to complete
                my code. It took a little troubleshooting because I didn't realize I had mispelled function so it would produce "Output: ", but nothing else. <br> Also I came across a symbol that am not familiar with, "/\b\w/g". It was used for my function
                in the second exercise. <br> Does it just mean the beginning and end of the word? I tried to research for myself, but I couldn't find any clear answers..</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
