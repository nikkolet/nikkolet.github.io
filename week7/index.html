            <b>Chapter 11: Futher Functioning</b>
            <p>In section 2 where it was talking about functions that define and rewrite themselves, I was wondering what was the purpose of redefining functions within iteself?<br> Normally, if I had an if-else statement I would just make two functions
                to deal with the different outcomes. Would I use redefining functions in this manner?</p>
            <p>I have learned that a Recursive Function is alot like a While Loop. I did a little more digging about what the difference was between a recursive function and a while loop.</p>
            <p>These are the websites I went on: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/182314/recursion-or-while-loops">www.softwareengineering.com</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://betterprogramming.pub/when-to-loop-when-to-recurse-b786ad8977de">www.betterprogramming.pub</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>So, if I am understanding correctly, it basically explained that recursive functions are better for long-term scalable programs to make code easier to organize and update, but it is more difficult to master than the while loop. I read one
                viewing that it's important to know the difference so interviewers can tell that you know how to write code versus if you simply know how to remember code syntax. Do you use recursive functions get used often where you work at the clinic?
                Would you say it would be worth mastering the recursive functions?</p>

            <b>Chapter 13: Ajax</b>
            <p>I learned about the different parts of the fetch() method. I learned the basic structure of how to use the .then() and .catch() methods. I used the fetch() methods before in previous codes, but I didn't understand them all too well. </p>
            <p>I am still kind of confused about the if throw statements within them. I get it works as an if-then, but I don't understand why don't they just use an if-then statement. </p>
