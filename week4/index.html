    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                Exercise 1 took exceedingly longer than I had originally expected. I had created forms before in previous semesters, but I wanted to try something different. <br>I decided to make a login page that could switch to a registration page.<br>                Like previous semesters, CSS is the bane of my existence. It turns out, my HTMl syntax was to blame.<br> I struggled with dealing with unknown divs that didn't have closing divs.
            </p>
            <p>I have discovered a new website to find icons:
                <a href="https://iconscout.com/unicons">www.iconsout.com</a></p>
            <p>
                In the JS portion of this code, I have found that the conditionals of =, ==, and === took time for me to learn. <br> When I was trying to write the code to change the eye icon, I noticed that when I put ==, the icons would change once
                and back once, but I was unable to change it again. <br> It was only when I put === that it would change whenever I clicked the icon. I looked up why that might be.
                <br> On <a href="https://www.scaler.com/topics/javascript/difference-between-double-equals-and-triple-equals-in-javascript/">www.scalar.com</a> I found out it was because == is considered loose equality and === is considered strict equality.
                <br>To be honest, that is as far as I was able to find. Why is it that when === becomes == it only goes through the js code once, but never again?

            </p>

            <p>Exercise 2 was a little more familiar to me, because I have created a quiz before, not not necessarily in this way before.<br> I am not as familiar with using the this keyword to call variables within a function. <br> I read up more about
                it on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this">www.mozilla.org/this</a></p>
            <p>I didn't realize how useful it could be, especially to change when something was hidden or viewed. Previously I solely used css, but it is so nice to be able to use JavaScript.
                <br> Most of my issues were just syntax errors. I would misspell my variables alot. I wish I had known last semester how to better utilize the this keyword. <br> Last semester, I used radio buttons to make multiple choice, so I decided
                to try something different.
            </p>

            <p>The team activity was pretty straight forward. I have completed a Tic Tac Toe in Python so at least the HTML and CSS part was easier. <br>It took some debugging to get the logic, but we got it.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
