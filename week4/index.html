                Exercise 1 took exceedingly longer than I had originally expected. I had created forms before in previous semesters, but I wanted to try something different. <br> I decided to make a login page that could switch to a registration page.<br>                Like previous semesters, CSS is the bane of my existence. It turns out, my HTMl syntax was to blame.<br> I struggled with dealing with unknown divs that didn't have closing divs.
