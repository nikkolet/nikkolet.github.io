            <h4>Ch8: Transforms and Transitions</h4>
            <p>To be honest,while reading this chapter, I have been having a difficult time visualizing what was written. I had to look up Youtube vidoes to understand the concepts.</p>
            <p>Here is a list of the videos I used: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzD-cPhq02E">Transformations</a>
                    <p>
                        For transforms, there are 3 main functions used: translate, scale, and rotate. Each has more than one option.<br><br> For example translate, can look like translate(), translate3D(), translateX(), translateY(), and translateZ().
                        All of the have such variations. <br><br>In the video he said, that 99% of the time when doing Web Development you will only use the original functions to create your CSS effects. <br>The others are only best when working with
                        3D animations which you probably won't work with very often.
