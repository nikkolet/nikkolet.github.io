            <h4>Ch8: Transforms and Transitions</h4>
            <p>To be honest,while reading this chapter, I have been having a difficult time visualizing what was written. I had to look up Youtube vidoes to understand the concepts.</p>
            <p>Here is a list of the videos I used: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzD-cPhq02E">Transformations</a>
                    <p>
                        For transforms, there are 3 main functions used: translate, scale, and rotate. Each has more than one option.<br><br>For example translate, can look like translate(), translate3D(), translateX(), translateY(), and translateZ().
                        All of the have such variations. <br><br>In the video he said, that 99% of the time when doing Web Development you will only use the original functions to create your CSS effects. <br>The others are only best when working with
                        3D animations which you probably won't work with very often. What is an example of 3D CSS animation where it would be relevant to use such variables?
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nloq6uzF8RQ">Transitions</a>
                    <p>For the transition-duration property we can use seconds(s) or miliseconds(ms). Though seconds seem a lot easier to write and read, it is a good rule of thumb to use miliseconds, because JavaScript only accepts miliseconds.</p>
                    <p>CSS variables are a great way to organize transforms that are being rewritten later without having to deal with large amounts of code. <br><br>Example: var(--varname, value);<br><br>This looks like it will come in handy later.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

            <h4>Ch12: Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h4>
            <p>Here I was struggling just watching this on a video or reading it, so I decided I would follow a long with a video to learn how to apply everything that we have been learning about.</p>
            <p>Here is the link to file I made: <a href="canvas.html">Canvas Tutorial HTML</a></p>
            <p>In the video, he explained that when using canvas there are four basic skills that you need: <br><br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Creating and Resizing your Canvas</li>
                    <li>Drawing Elements</li>
                    <li>Animating Elements</li>
                    <li>Interacting with Elements</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>There are six canvas objects:
                <ol>
                    <li>Rectangles</li>
                    <li>Lines</li>
                    <li>Arcs/Circles</li>
                    <li>Bezier Curves</li>
                    <li>Images</li>
                    <li>Text</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>Here are links to the videos I watched: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO6OkltgudE&t=237s">Canvas HTML ep. 1</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83L6B13ixQ0">Canvas HTML ep. 2</a></p>
            <p>The height and width set in JavaScript helps so that when you give height and width 100% it will actually look that way on the screen. It does not appear that way on CSS alone.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Team Activity</h3>
    <a href="starWarsAPI.html">starWarsAPI</a>
    <p>For our Team Activity, we have noticed a reoccuring problmem for the team. Cooper and I are on laptops (Cooper is on a MacBook and I am on a Windows 11 PC), while Marcus is on a desktop.</p>
    <p>For Cooper and I, we keep getting a 404 error in our console whenever we inspect the webpage because it doesn't show the data that Marcos is viewing from his end. We double-checked our code against the teacher's solution, but the problem doens't seem
        to resolve. We are all using the same URL path.</p>
    <p>I had similar issues last semester. I was able to view some of the photos I imported from an API because it said the port the server was sending information to was closed to me.<br><br> Do you think sometime next week you could meet with me and Cooper
        so that we can try to figure this out. I don't want the students using laptops to be unable to complete the semester project because of these issues.</p>
