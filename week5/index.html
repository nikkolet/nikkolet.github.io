    <h3>Notes</h3>

        <li>
            <p>For the Team Activity this week, things had to change because one member of our group left the class and we received a new team member. <br> I worked on the CSS portion of the assignment and added my team members as collaborators to my GitHub
                Repository. <br> I struggle with my margins. It seems that even though it looked fine on my PC, the text looked overlapping on my team members Mac.<br> This is the css portion that had the struggle I am referring too: <br> div div { float:
                right; margin: 1em; margin-top: -18em; font-size: 24px; margin-right: 13em;}
                <br> I know there is a better way to make the margin and padding more compatible across multiple devices.
                <br> I did find this website that will help me out in the future: <a href="https://matthewjamestaylor.com/responsive-padding">Responsive Padding</a>
                <br> Are there any other suggestions? <a href="index1.html">TeamActivity</a>

                The exercises I worked on were interesting. The Roll Dice took fewer code than I thought it would.
