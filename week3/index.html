    <h2>Week 3</h2>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>For the first exercise I had to experiement a little bit. At first I did use the methods: .getDate(), .getmonth(), .getFullYear(), and .getDay().<br> I even made a daysOfWeek array and months of Year array and made a concated string that included
                the variables for day, month, year, and dayname for the returning string. <br> Everthing except for the dayName was functioning perfectly. My variables were outside of my .onclick functions, but it didn't make sense why everything else
                worked, but my dayName variable didn't. <br> I did some experimenting and found where I can just call the entire date and the -1 for the .getDate() method for yesterday and +1 to for tomorrow. <br> I chose to show this instead of my arrays
                and my previous variables, because for me it is the same information I wanted to present, but simpified and with fewer lines of code.<br> I was thinking it would be more efficent to write this code than what I previously had.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The second exercise was surprisingly a lot easier to code, especially in comparison to the first exercise. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>My team as a quesiton about one of the exercises we were given in our Team Activity Exercises List. <br> In Exercise 4, we were able to figure out this solution before we looked at the teacher solution. We have: <br> <br> const years = inventors.reduce((total,
                inventor) => { return total + (inventor.passed - inventor.year); }, 0);
                <br><br> What is the purpose of the , 0 after the curly brackets? Does it work like the .toFixed() method? <br> We know it works, and when we are without the , 0 after the curly brackets it gives us a long number that seems to be the location
                of the object in the system, but we don't know why it works.<br> Will you please help us understand?
            </p>
